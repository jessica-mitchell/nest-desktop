Hello there!

we are making changes!

NEST Desktop is a web-based GUI application for NEST Simulator,
an advanced simulation tool for the computational neuroscience.

The app enables the rapid construction, parametrization,
and instrumentation of neuronal network models.

It's so great that you want to use NEST Desktop.

**Let's get started.**

How the documentation is organized
----------------------------------

The documentation is organized into three sections. Select the appropriate section that fits your needs.

.. raw:: html

    <div class="doc">
      <div class="column user">
        <a href="user/index.html">
          <div>
            <img src="_static/img/font-awesome/user.svg">
            <h2>The User</h2>
            <p>
              ... learns how to build networks, parameterize nodes and links,
              and perform simulations on the graphical interface.
            </p>
            <span class="whoami">I am a user.</span>
          </div>
        </a>
      </div>

      <div class="column deployer">
        <a href="deployer/index.html">
          <div>
            <img src="_static/img/font-awesome/user-cog.svg">
            <h2>The Deployer</h2>
            <p>
              ... learns how to set up NEST Desktop on a machine via the Python Package, Docker or Singularity installation.
            </p>
            <span class="whoami">I am a deployer.</span>
          </div>
