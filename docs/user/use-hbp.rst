How to use NEST Desktop on HBP resources
=========================================


NEST Desktop is integrated into the infrastructure of the Human Brain Project (HBP).
An HBP account is required to access it.

If you have an HBP account, follow the link below:

* https://nest-desktop.apps.hbp.eu.

If not, you can ask a member of HBP to invite you or request an account here:

Why cannot I find NEST Server?
  Sometimes the issue is resolved when you try to check NEST Server.
  If not, the problem lies in cookie and site data for user authentication of HBP.
  That cookie expires after a session. This happens when you close the browser, then open the browser and try to access to https://nest-desktop.apps.hbp.eu.
  The simple solution is to reload the page that you can re-login HBP infrastructure.
  Another persistent solution is to set the browser configuration that it deletes cookies and site data when the browser is closed (It works in Firefox).
